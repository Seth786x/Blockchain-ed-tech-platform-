\section{Introduction}
Access to computer hardware is essential for modern education, yet many institutions face resource scarcity and opaque funding processes. According to a recent UNESCO report \cite{b15}, over 60\% of schools in developing countries lack access to adequate computer hardware, significantly hindering students' ability to learn essential digital skills. Donors often lack visibility into how their contributions are utilized, leading to mistrust and reduced engagement. Traditional donation systems are centralized, prone to errors, and offer limited auditability.

Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, provides a compelling foundation for transparent and secure resource management. Advances in smart contracts and decentralized storage enable automated, auditable workflows that can transform educational funding and resource allocation.

This paper introduces a blockchain-enabled EdTech platform designed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enable donors to track and verify the use of their contributions in real time.
    \item Integrate modern web technologies for usability and scalability.
    \item Address the unique challenges of hardware resource allocation in education.
\end{itemize}

The novelty of our approach lies in combining blockchain-based donation tracking with automated hardware resource allocation, supported by a full-stack architecture and decentralized storage. We compare our solution to existing systems, highlight its advantages, and present a detailed evaluation.

% Expanded Literature Review
\section{Related Work}
Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing transparency and accountability in educational funding. Foundational work by Nakamoto \cite{b1} and Buterin \cite{b2} established the principles for decentralized applications, while Xu et al.\cite{b3} demonstrated their effectiveness in education funding. Recent studies by Smith et al. \cite{b12} and Johnson et al. \cite{b13} show significant advantages of blockchain-based donation platforms over traditional systems, particularly in transparency and resource allocation.

Our platform addresses a critical gap in existing solutions by focusing specifically on computer hardware education, combining blockchain-based donation tracking with automated resource allocation. This approach provides a practical solution for transparent and efficient management of educational resources, addressing limitations in current centralized systems that lack real-time auditability and automated distribution mechanisms.

\section{Enhanced Literature Review and Analysis}
Recent research (2020-2025) demonstrates blockchain's growing adoption in education for credential verification, resource management, and funding. Studies show significant benefits in transparency, cost reduction, and trust through decentralized platforms. Smart contracts enable automated resource allocation and reduce administrative overhead, while cryptographic verification ensures tamper-proof records. Comparative analyses consistently show blockchain's advantages over centralized systems in transaction visibility, cost efficiency, and trust establishment.

\subsection{Theoretical Framework}
Our platform's design is grounded in established theories:

\textbf{Trust and Security:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Immutable ledgers and cryptographic verification
    \item Distributed consensus preventing single points of failure
    \item Byzantine fault tolerance and continuous audit capability
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced transaction costs (0.1-0.5\% gas fees)
    \item 80\% reduction in administrative overhead
    \item 40-60\% increase in donor retention
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time transaction tracking and automated reporting
    \item Cross-institutional resource sharing
    \item Smart contract automation of key processes
\end{itemize}

Overall, this framework shows blockchain offers better ways to build trust, cut costs, ensure transparency, and improve security over old centralized donation methods. It's especially good for allocating hardware in education, where being accountable and efficient really matters.

\section{System Design}
\subsection{Architecture}
The platform is built as a modular full-stack system integrating five key technologies. The Vue.js frontend provides a user-friendly interface for donors, students, and administrators, enabling secure logins, donation tracking, and hardware requests. FastAPI serves as the backend, handling business logic, validating user actions, and managing communication with the blockchain and database. MongoDB stores user profiles, donation records, hardware inventory, and links to audit trails, ensuring fast access and compliance. Ethereum smart contracts automate donation recording and hardware allocation, guaranteeing transparency and security through immutable transactions and event logs. IPFS is used for decentralized storage of documents and receipts, making all supporting files tamper-proof and publicly accessible. The system’s workflow ensures that every donation and allocation is tracked from initiation to completion, with real-time updates and public auditability, leveraging the strengths of each technology for a robust, transparent educational resource management solution.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:techstack}
\end{table}

\subsection{Smart Contracts}
The blockchain layer of the platform is built around two core Solidity smart contracts: EdTechDonation and HardwareCourses. The EdTechDonation contract oversees the donation lifecycle, ensuring each contribution is permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and linked to specific hardware requirements and donor details. It generates events for every transaction, facilitating real-time auditing and enhancing transparency. Meanwhile, the HardwareCourses contract streamlines the distribution of computer hardware by enforcing eligibility criteria and allocation rules. Its primary functions include processing donations, validating hardware requests, and approving allocations, all safeguarded by strict access controls to prevent unauthorized activities. Security is further reinforced through mechanisms such as input validation, role-based permissions, and detailed event logging. These contracts are deployed and managed using Hardhat, with backend integration of ABI updates to ensure smooth communication. By utilizing Ethereum’s decentralized framework, the contracts ensure that all donations and allocations are secure, verifiable, and executed in accordance with clear, predefined rules, forming the foundation of the platform’s reliability and transparency.

\subsection{Transparency and Security}
The platform ensures transparency by recording all donations and hardware allocations on the Ethereum blockchain, making every transaction both immutable and publicly verifiable. Events are triggered for each action, enabling donors and administrators to monitor the flow of funds and resources in real time. Additionally, IPFS is employed to store essential documents, such as receipts and hardware images, ensuring these files remain tamper-proof and readily accessible for verification.

\subsection{Architectural Design Report}
To provide a clear understanding of the platform’s structure and data flow, we present a detailed architectural design report. This section describes the major components, their interactions, and the rationale behind technology choices.

\textbf{System Overview:}
The platform is organized into five main layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Interface (Vue.js)}: The entry point for donors, students, and administrators. Handles authentication, displays hardware needs, donation status, and allocation dashboards.
    \item \textbf{API Layer (FastAPI)}: Serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend logic. Validates requests, manages sessions, and routes data securely.
    \item \textbf{Business Logic (FastAPI + Web3.py)}: Implements core workflows—donation processing, hardware allocation, user management, and blockchain interaction.
    \item \textbf{Data Storage (MongoDB + IPFS)}: Stores user profiles, donation records, hardware inventory, and immutable documents. MongoDB handles structured data; IPFS stores files and receipts.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Layer (Ethereum Smart Contracts)}: Enforces transparent, automated rules for donations and allocations. All critical transactions are recorded immutably.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Component Roles and Interactions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend (Vue.js)}: Presents forms for donations and hardware requests, displays real-time status, and provides links to blockchain explorers and IPFS documents.
    \item \textbf{Backend (FastAPI)}: Validates user actions, interacts with smart contracts, updates MongoDB, and manages IPFS uploads. Handles error reporting and security checks.
    \item \textbf{Smart Contracts (Solidity)}: Automate donation recording, allocation logic, and event emission for audit trails. Prevent unauthorized actions via access controls.
    \item \textbf{MongoDB}: Maintains off-chain records for fast querying and reporting. Links blockchain transaction hashes and IPFS content IDs to user actions.
    \item \textbf{IPFS}: Stores images, receipts, and documents. Ensures files are tamper-proof and publicly accessible.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Flow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Donor initiates a donation via the frontend.
    \item Frontend sends data to backend API, which validates and forwards to the smart contract.
    \item Smart contract records the donation, emits an event, and updates the blockchain.
    \item Backend listens for events, updates MongoDB, and uploads any related files to IPFS.
    \item Frontend displays confirmation, transaction hash, and links to IPFS and blockchain explorer.
    \item Administrators manage hardware requests and allocations, with all actions logged and auditable.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Technology Selection:}
Key technologies were chosen for their specific capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vue.js}: Reactive UI for real-time updates and user interaction
    \item \textbf{FastAPI}: High-performance backend with async support
    \item \textbf{MongoDB}: Flexible data storage for varied platform needs
    \item \textbf{Ethereum}: Secure smart contracts and transaction verification
    \item \textbf{IPFS}: Decentralized document storage and accessibility
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}
The platform was developed using Vue.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence. Ethereum smart contracts were written in Solidity and tested using Hardhat. IPFS was integrated for decentralized storage of documents and receipts. The backend communicates with smart contracts using Web3.py, and all major user actions—donations and hardware requests—are tracked and stored. The system was deployed and tested on cloud infrastructure to ensure basic scalability and reliability.

\textbf{Implementation Challenges:}
Key challenges included integrating blockchain event listeners with the backend, handling asynchronous transaction confirmations, and ensuring secure uploads to IPFS. We also faced issues with smart contract ABI updates and managing user roles in the backend. Additionally, obtaining Sepolia ETH for testing was difficult due to limited faucet availability and network scarcity, which slowed down development and testing cycles. These were resolved through iterative testing, error handling, and modular code design. All features described were implemented and tested in the final platform.
