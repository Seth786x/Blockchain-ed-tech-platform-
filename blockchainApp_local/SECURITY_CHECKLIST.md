## ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Need Attention

### High Priority
- [ ] **Multi-signature wallet for contract ownership**
- [ ] **Real-time ETH price feed integration**
- [ ] **Transaction verification before recording**
- [ ] **Rate limiting on API endpoints**
- [ ] **HTTPS/SSL configuration**

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Input validation on all endpoints**
- [ ] **JWT token refresh mechanism**
- [ ] **Database connection pooling**
- [ ] **API versioning**
- [ ] **Comprehensive logging**

### Smart Contract Auditing
- [ ] **Professional smart contract audit**
- [ ] **Gas optimization review**
- [ ] **Reentrancy attack testing**
- [ ] **Integer overflow/underflow testing**
- [ ] **Access control testing**

## üîß Deployment Security

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Secure environment template created
- [x] Configuration validator implemented
- [ ] **Production environment setup**
- [ ] **Secret management system**

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Firewall configuration**

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end donation flow
- [ ] Course purchase flow
- [ ] User authentication flow

### Security Tests
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Smart contract fuzzing
- [ ] API security testing

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### Performance
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] CDN setup for frontend
- [ ] Caching strategy

### Monitoring
- [ ] Application monitoring

## üèÜ Overall Assessment

**Current State**: Development/Testing Ready ‚úÖ
**Production Ready**: ‚ùå (Needs security audit and additional fixes)

**Main Blockers for Production**:
1. Smart contract security audit required
2. Multi-signature wallet implementation needed
3. Comprehensive testing suite required
4. Production infrastructure setup needed

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 2-4 weeks with dedicated effort
